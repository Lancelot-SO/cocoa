                            Cocoa, like other commodities traded on international markets, experienced significant variations
                            during the pandemic. Consumption rose during the pandemic, even though markets were expecting a
                            demand contraction on the consumer side. Chocolate, one of its derivative products, was an exception
                            since demand fell with the temporary shut-downs of hotels, restaurants and airports. At the same time,
                            the cocoa marketing chain remained active, with 2020 being a good year in terms of production and quality.
                            Farmers had the opportunity to dedicate themselves to improving their production process,
                            allowing them to achieve higher quality beans and thus, an increase in exports.

                            How can cocoa production be sustainable?
                            Due to globalization and consumer awareness, sustainability in the food production chain has become a basic requirement.
                            The cocoa industry strives to meet the huge demand that is now more focused than ever on the adoption of good farming methods
                            and responsible management of natural resources. Sustainable cocoa production is based on quality guidelines and standards,
                            and is characterized by production, environmental and social benefits.

                            A good sustainability plan provides a series of tools, training and guidelines for large and small producers.

                                In this way, consumersâ€™ commitment to environmental protection, proper land use and fair economic recognition of
                                farmers and communities involved in the production process is fulfilled.

                                Through international certifications, many organizations monitor and ensure the sustainability of crops. In this way,
                                organizations such as Fair Trade, Rainforest Alliance, Organic and UTZ, make possible the production of a pure grain that
                                faithfully follows good cultivation practices and differs significantly from a market dominated by the exploitation of soils and communities.
